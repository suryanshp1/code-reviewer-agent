## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our software seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in the Code Reviewer CI Agent, please report it to us as described below.

### **DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public issues.**

### Reporting Process

3.  **Response**: We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide an estimated timeline for triage and resolution.

### Disclosure Policy

*   We ask that you do not disclose the vulnerability to the public until we have had a chance to fix it.
*   We will work to fix the vulnerability as quickly as possible.
*   Once fixed, we will publish a security advisory and credit you for the discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).
